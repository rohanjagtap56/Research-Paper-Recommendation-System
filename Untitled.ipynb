      "Abstract: b'Transfer learning has gained attention in medical image analysis due to\\nlimited annotated 3D medical datasets for training data-driven deep learning\\nmodels in the real world. Existing 3D-based methods have transferred the\\npre-trained models to downstream tasks, which achieved promising results with\\nonly a small number of training samples. However, they demand a massive amount\\nof parameters to train the model for 3D medical imaging. In this work, we\\npropose a novel transfer learning framework, called Medical Transformer, that\\neffectively models 3D volumetric images in the form of a sequence of 2D image\\nslices. To make a high-level representation in 3D-form empowering spatial\\nrelations better, we take a multi-view approach that leverages plenty of\\ninformation from the three planes of 3D volume, while providing\\nparameter-efficient training. For building a source model generally applicable\\nto various tasks, we pre-train the model in a self-supervised learning manner\\nfor masked encoding vector prediction as a proxy task, using a large-scale\\nnormal, healthy brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset. Our pre-trained\\nmodel is evaluated on three downstream tasks: (i) brain disease diagnosis, (ii)\\nbrain age prediction, and (iii) brain tumor segmentation, which are actively\\nstudied in brain MRI research. The experimental results show that our Medical\\nTransformer outperforms the state-of-the-art transfer learning methods,\\nefficiently reducing the number of parameters up to about 92% for\\nclassification and'\n",

      "Abstract: b'Recently deep convolutional neural networks have achieved significant success\\nin salient object detection. However, existing state-of-the-art methods require\\nhigh-end GPUs to achieve real-time performance, which makes them hard to adapt\\nto low-cost or portable devices. Although generic network architectures have\\nbeen proposed to speed up inference on mobile devices, they are tailored to the\\ntask of image classification or semantic segmentation, and struggle to capture\\nintra-channel and inter-channel correlations that are essential for contrast\\nmodeling in salient object detection. Motivated by the above observations, we\\ndesign a new deep learning algorithm for fast salient object detection. The\\nproposed algorithm for the first time achieves competitive accuracy and high\\ninference efficiency simultaneously with a single CPU thread. Specifically, we\\npropose a novel depthwise non-local moudule (DNL), which implicitly models\\ncontrast via harvesting intra-channel and inter-channel correlations in a\\nself-attention manner. In addition, we introduce a depthwise non-local network\\narchitecture that incorporates both depthwise non-local modules and inverted\\nresidual blocks. Experimental results show that our proposed network attains\\nvery competitive accuracy on a wide range of salient object detection datasets\\nwhile achieving state-of-the-art efficiency among all existing deep learning\\nbased algorithms.'\n",

      "Abstract: b'This paper presents a novel hierarchical Bayesian model for unbiased atlas\\nbuilding with subject-specific regularizations of image registration. We\\ndevelop an atlas construction process that automatically selects parameters to\\ncontrol the smoothness of diffeomorphic transformation according to individual\\nimage data. To achieve this, we introduce a hierarchical prior distribution on\\nregularization parameters that allows multiple penalties on images with various\\ndegrees of geometric transformations. We then treat the regularization\\nparameters as latent variables and integrate them out from the model by using\\nthe Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) algorithm. Another advantage of\\nour algorithm is that it eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, which\\ncan be tedious and infeasible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on\\n3D brain MR images. Experimental results show that our model provides a sharper\\natlas compared to the current atlas building algorithms with single-penalty\\nregularizations.

We also show how our formulation is easy to realize in\\npractical network architectures via a reverse pass, which aims for\\nreconstructing the full sequence of internal states of the network. Despite\\nbeing a surprisingly simple change, we demonstrate that this forward-backward\\ntraining approach, which we refer to as {\\\\em racecar} training, leads to\\nsignificantly more generic features being extracted from a given data set.\\nNetworks trained with our approach show more balanced mutual information\\nbetween input and output throughout all layers, yield improved explainability\\nand, exhibit improved performance for a variety of tasks and task transfers.'\n",

    "new_abstract = 'Deep networks and decision forests (such as random forests and gradient\\nboosted trees) are the leading machine learning methods for structured and\\ntabular data, respectively. Many papers have empirically compared large numbers\\nof classifiers on one or two different domains (e.g., on 100 different tabular\\ndata settings). However, a careful conceptual and empirical comparison of these\\ntwo strategies using the most contemporary best practices has yet to be\\nperformed. Conceptually, we illustrate that both can be profitably viewed as\\n\"partition and vote\" schemes. Specifically, the representation space that they\\nboth learn is a partitioning of feature space into a union of convex polytopes.\\nFor inference, each decides on the basis of votes from the activated nodes.\\nThis formulation allows for a unified basic understanding of the relationship\\nbetween these methods. Empirically, we compare these two strategies on hundreds\\nof tabular data settings, as well as several vision and auditory settings. Our\\nfocus is on datasets with at most 10,000 samples, which represent a large\\nfraction of scientific and biomedical datasets. In general, we found forests to\\nexcel at tabular and structured data (vision and audition) with small sample\\nsizes, whereas deep nets performed better on structured data with larger sample\\nsizes. This suggests that further gains in both scenarios may be realized via\\nfurther combining aspects of forests and networks. We will continue revising\\nthis technical report in the coming months with updated results.'\n",
